# Shiny r Visualization
 Visualization loaded using R via shiny apps url: "https://kngm45-rahil0shaikh.shinyapps.io/shiny_r/"
  
  It was difficult understanding the features of posit and R because I am so used to Google Colab and Shell.  I started playing around with it and spent several hours trying to get the code to work and especially connecting to shiny for displaying through a url. I was able to get the visualization pretty quickly but connecting to shiny took me some time and error searching. I do like R and the layout seems easy  to work with. I like how easy it is to write code on the terminal and how right click features still work unlike google shell.
