## Week 4: Web-Based Data Visualization Using Shiny and Flask
### 1. Shiny R

It was difficult understanding the features of posit and R because I am so used to Google Colab and Shell. I started playing around with it and spent several hours trying to get the code to work and especially connecting to shiny for displaying through a url. I was able to get the visualization pretty quickly but connecting to shiny took me some time and error searching. I do like R and the layout seems easy to work with. I like how easy it is to write code on the terminal and how right click features still work unlike google shell.

### 2. Shiny Python

The python and shiny for r code were very similar so it was easy acquiring the visual through python and shiny. Installing the shiny package was easy through google shell and I had no errors. Cloning to github was a familiar process done before. I prefer this way out of the three for loading the visualization. 

### 3. MatPlotlib Python Flask App

This process took me the longest but my only error was not creating a templates folder and not placing the html in the templates folder. Once i figured this out I was able to run the program through flask app. The coding was easy and I like how you can display this on a html so it is easier for non tech ppl to see.
